Program Description

Assignment #9 will be the construction of a program that reads in
a sequence of integers from standard input until 0 is read,
and store them in an array (including 0).
This is done using iteration (choose one of for, while, or do while loop).
You may assume that there will not be more than 100 numbers.

Then
compute the minimum number,
compute the sum of odd numbers, count negative numbers,
and compute the sum of numbers in the array are less than the last number entered right before 0.
(You can assume that a user will enter at least one non-zero number before 0 is entered.)
using recursion. Thus you will create recursive methods
findMin, computeSumOfOdd, countNagative, and sumLessThanLast in Assignment9 class and they will be called by a main method.

Specifically, the following recursive methods must be implemented (These methods should not contain any loop):

    public static int findMin(int[] numbers, int startIndex, int endIndex)
    public static int computeSumOfOdd(int[] numbers, int startIndex, int endIndex)

    public static int countNegative(int[] numbers, int startIndex, int endIndex)
    public static int sumLessThanLast(int[] numbers, int startIndex, int endIndex, int lastNumber)

If these methods are implemented using a Loop or any Static Variable,
points will be deducted (from the test cases) even if your program passes test cases.
DO NOT use any Static Variables.

The program should output the results of those calculations to standard output.
Your program will continue to read in numbers until the number 0 is entered.
At this point, the calculations will be outputted in the following format:

The minimum number is 0
The sum of odd numbers is 0
The count of negative numbers is 0
The sum of numbers that are less than the last is 0


Note that the result values will be different depending on test cases (not always 0).
Do not output a prompt to query for the numbers.
The number 0 is included in the sequence of numbers and should be included in all of your calculations.
